# -Sample.size.simulation
Sample size simulation and calculation tool

The following Shiny app was the final project for week 4 of the "Data Products" class 
on Coursera which was part of the Data Science Specialization. The app starts with 
instructions on motivation for the app and how to use it.

Things to add
- create another tab and add charts showing the resulting p valaues from repeated
tests at different sample sizes.
- fix code so any mean or sd value can be used
